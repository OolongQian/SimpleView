### Motivation 

In this work, we learn how detail is important in AI. 
The author carefully compares various learning protocols. 
This is pretty good! 
We need to pay attention to this. 
I realize that it is virtually impossible to do research without the open-sourced code. 
I realize that we need to setup a solid baseline to progress the research work! 
Idea cannot be validated without a solid baseline. 
This work opens the possibility to further research work. 
I need to have my baseline!

We find that the un-open-sourced work isn't mentioned! 

### Progress

This work uses DGCNN's protocol with Pointnet++ model selection. 

python main.py --exp-config configs/dgcnn_<model_name>_valid_run_<seed>.yaml
python main.py --exp-config configs/dgcnn_<model_name>_run_<seed>.yaml


### Code Reading 

I find that the code of this work is not a big deal. But I should carefully learn its machine learning setup. 
Let's read how this training baseline is set up.


### Benchmark

After reading other papers, I realize that, although this is not a benchmark accepted by all other people, we find that this 
    is a benchmark nevertheless, which can be acknowledged by a broad number of people. 


### Progress 

My first attempt fails! 
Next I try the existing way to fuse multi-modality feature.
